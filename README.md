The worksheets represent the detailed Python code for collating and analyzing the incidence and fatality rates for the 10 most common and fatal cancers in 56 African countries from 5 different African regions (North, West, East, Central, and South) over 16-years (2002–2018). Analysis is performed by gender, by Human Development Index, and by the number of available medical devices. 

We classify the 10 cancers into 3 categories based on their risk factors: genetics, environmental/lifestyle and infectious-disease linked cancers. Northern and Southern Africa were most similar in their cancer incidences and fatality rates compared to other African regions, likely due to similarities in urbanization and lifestyle westernization. The most prevalent cancers are breast, bladder and liver cancers in Northern Africa; prostate, lung and colorectal cancers in Southern Africa, and esophageal and cervical cancer in East Africa. The incidence of breast, prostate and cervical cancers are increasing in all African regions, representing a public health burden, particularly in Northern and Southern Africa. Fatality rates for breast cancer have decreased during the last years thanks to increased awareness and improvement in healthcare facilities. In Southern Africa, in particular, fatality rates from prostate and cervical cancer (in 2018) have increased.  In addition, these three cancers are less fatal in Northern and Southern Africa compared to other regions, which correlates with the Human Development Index and the availability of medical devices. With the exception of thyroid cancer, incidence was higher in males than females for the remaining six relevant cancer types. 

We have gathered and analyzed the fluctuation in incidence and fatality rates for the 10 most common and fatal cancers in 5 different regions (North, West, East, Central and South) over a 16-year period (2002-2018). We classified the 10 studied cancers into 3 categories based on their risk factors: genetics, environmental/lifestyle and infectious-disease linked cancers. The incidence of breast, prostate and cervical cancers are increasing in all African regions, representing a public health burden, particularly in Northern and Southern Africa. Northern and Southern Africa were most similar in their cancer incidences and fatality rates compared to other African regions, likely due to similarities in urbanization and westernization of lifestyles. The most prevalent cancers are breast, bladder and liver cancers in Northern Africa; prostate, lung and colorectal cancers in Southern Africa, and esophageal and cervical cancer in East Africa. Fatality rates for breast cancer have decreased during the last years thanks to efforts devoted to awareness and improvement of healthcare facilities. In Southern Africa, in particular, fatality rates from prostate cancer and cervical cancer (in 2018) have increased.  In addition, these three cancers are less fatal in Northern and Southern Africa compared to other regions, which correlates with the Human Development Index and the availability of medical devices. With the exception of thyroid cancer, our results showed that all  remaining nine cancer types have higher incidences in males than females. 

Our results highlight the urgent need for African countries to put cancer in the forefront of health care priorities. The African continent suffers from a shortage of medical equipment, medical staff and epidemiological expertise. We see a need for implementing more accurate preventive strategies to tackle this disease as many cases are likely preventable. Opportunities exist for vaccination programs for cervical and liver cancer, genetic testing and use of new targeted therapies for breast and prostate cancer, and positive changes in lifestyle for lung, colorectal and bladder cancers. Such recommendations should be tailored for the different African regions depending on their disease profiles and specific needs.
